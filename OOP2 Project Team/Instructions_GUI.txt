Please go through some short tips, which are ...

1. Remove Buttons where not needed. The TreeViewItems should simply expand to view sub-options. The

   sub-options, when clicked, should view the page containing buttons for performing the specified

   operation.

	Example:

	> Entitlements --> Expands and views the sub-options when clicked

		> Add Entitlements --> Navigates to the page for adding entitlements

		> Employee Entitlements --> Navigates to the page that views entitlements

2. Keep Page references as private attributes for the class MainWindow. Calling the constructor for a

   new Page every time navigation is done consumes memory + time = money.

	Example:
	
	public partial class MainWindow : Window
	
	{
	    
	//  Store page references
	    
	    private Page page_1, page_2 ... page_n;
	    
	    public MainWindow()	{
		
		page_1 = new Page(Container.Height, Container.Width);
		
		page_2 = new Page(Container.Height, Container.Width);
		
		.
		.
		.
	    
	    }

	    .
	    .
	    .
	
	}

	N.B: Instead of Page, use the respective classes inherited from Page.



3. Remove GetPage(height : double, width : double) : Page. Maintain the size by passing values to the

   constructor as shown in the previous example for shortening code.



4. If possible, remove public static Frame page_container from the MainWindow. The Pages should

   contain private methods for handling button click events and hence the page_container is not

   needed. Similarly the class MainWindow should contain only private methods for navigating

   through pages.
